Fish Shell
==========

To install auto-completion for Fish Shell, you will need to copy `rain.fish` to `~/.config/fish/completions/`.
Once the file is copied, simply open a new fish shell and auto-completion should begin working for you.   Currently,
basic auto complete support is available for the ssh, note, add, and delete commands.
